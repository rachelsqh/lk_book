Description: program for managing a Netfilter firewall
 The Uncomplicated FireWall is a front-end for iptables, to make managing a
 Netfilter firewall easier. It provides a command line interface with syntax
 similar to OpenBSD's Packet Filter. It is particularly well-suited as a
 host-based firewall.
